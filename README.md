This is the repository for some scripts I write to help me deal with the 
duplicate work.
#### set_git_proxy.sh
Set and unset proxy for Git, using for Linux virtual machine. Run './set_git_proxy.sh -h' for more help.
#### add_clangd_inc_path.bat
Add the include path for clangd. Drag this file to the include path root directory and run. Then it will add that directory and its subdirectories as clangd's include path into 'compile_flags.txt'
